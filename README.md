# SafetyinDensity

This file contains the original Safety in Density Model from 2014.

It demonstrates behaviour of cars and cyclists that live in a Manhattan grid.

The main variables to manipulate relate to the energy loss that bicycles feel when they are exposed to cars.

Too much loss and they stop riding where they are and transfer to somewhere close to where other riders are located.

The total nuber of crashes between cars and bicycles are recorded in the system.
